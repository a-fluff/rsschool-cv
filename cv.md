## About me
I fell in love with front-end more than a year ago and since then I've been striving to gain as much knowledge and experience as possible and become a successful and sought-after specialist in that field.
I started learning development on my own, practiced at the HTML Academy, and then took front-end development courses from Adukar. In my free time, I read specialized books, for example, "You don't know JS", solve katas, watch educational videos on YouTube and write a web application for learning English using flashcards.

  hours = hours < 10 ? `0${hours}` : hours;
  let minutes = Math.floor(seconds%3600/60);
  minutes = minutes < 10 ? `0${minutes}` : minutes;
  let leftSeconds = Math.floor(seconds%3600%60);
  leftSeconds = leftSeconds < 10 ? `0${leftSeconds}` : leftSeconds;
